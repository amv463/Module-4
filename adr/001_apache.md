# Choice of webserver

# Status: accepted

# Context:

Apache is open source HTTP corss-platform web server that I have chose
to use for the purpose of this application. While hosting for the application, 
it will also process request when necessary.

# Decision:

Because Apache is a free to use popular websever software, I chose to go with it 
for the creation of this application. Though I don't have much practice 
with the software, Docker Hub provides official containers that'll allow for 
a reliable web connectivity for the application. 

# Consequences:

Little effort is required to deploy a functional webserver for the application.
