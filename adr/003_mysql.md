# Choice of database

#Status: accepted

#Context:

MySQL is an open-source relational database management system. This will be 
the software used to implement a database for managing users in the application.

#Decision:

MySQL is the database software I chose for the application because of my past 
experience of using it in previous classes and due to how easy it is to structure 
and add data for a database system. This software will allow me to create a
database that will be able to implement a CRUD procedure for the application by
allowing forms to retrieve and return data from the database. While its primary 
focus is on the CRUD procedures, it could provide ACID properties if necessary. 

#Consequences:

There is not much of a effort to update the database system and
implementation for it.
